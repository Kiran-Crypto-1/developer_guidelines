# EchorTech Developer Guidelines & Engineering Standards

**Version 1.0** | Authoritative Onboarding & Reference Guide

This repository contains the comprehensive developer guidelines and engineering standards for EchorTech. This document serves as the foundation for our engineering culture transformation, moving from "ticket closers" to "domain-aware engineers."

## 🎯 Purpose

This initiative is an **Engineering Culture Transformation** designed to solve the problem of "Robotic Execution" in our development team. The guidelines emphasize:

- **Context-First Development**: Understanding the domain, currency of trust, and stakes before writing code
- **End-to-End Ownership**: Developers own their changes from design to production monitoring
- **Fundamentals Over Frameworks**: Strong understanding of core concepts before relying on tools
- **Quality as Mandatory**: Testing and validation are not optional

## 📋 Contents

The guidelines cover 8 core areas:

1. **Engineering Philosophy** - Fundamentals, clarity, and ownership principles
2. **Responsibility & Ownership** - End-to-end accountability and Definition of Ready
3. **Testing & Quality Standards** - Mandatory testing practices and quality criteria
4. **Responsible LLM Usage** - Safe and effective use of AI tools in development
5. **Frontend Engineering Standards** - Browser fundamentals, React, and performance
6. **Backend, Data & Systems Engineering** - Databases, async processing, failure-aware design
7. **Cloud, DevOps & Delivery Standards** - Infrastructure, CI/CD, and production operations
8. **Communication, Security & Professional Conduct** - Team standards and best practices
